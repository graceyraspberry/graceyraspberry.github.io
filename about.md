<p>I am a junior majoring in EECS and Business Administration (Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, & Technology Program).  I’m also getting a certificate in Design. </p>

This summer at Immunomind, a bioinformatics company revolutionizing immune system analysis, I conducted over 50 user interviews with researchers who were customers, identified their needs, and used those insights to contribute to our product roadmap. I identified that there was huge potential to customize functions for [COVID analysis](https://gracelam-77186.medium.com/the-story-of-covid-19-told-by-your-immune-system-1ff188334196), and I coded some of those function in our open source R package. Through my interviews, I also found that there was a lot of confusion on how to get started, so I wrote [tutorials](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/load_mixcr.html) for researchers to load different types of data into the pipeline.

I love tackling hard problems in society using clever technology, and have won two healthcare hackathons, an [AR and ML app to test for dizziness and stroke](https://medium.com/the-coleman-fung-institute/ihackhealth-uc-berkeley-and-ucsf-hold-inaugural-cross-bay-appathon-event-5abccdc596bd), and an ed-tech solution that [analyzes questions on classroom forums](https://github.com/graceyraspberry/Infocamp2020data). Our app was accepted into an incubator at Skydeck. I’m also a design fellow and sprint manager at IDEO CoLab, where I prototype solutions and lead multi-week design sprints with our fellows and industry partners.

I’m often the “hustler” on a team and am great at managing myself on remote projects. I’ve not only figured out how to succeed myself, but also how to encourage my team to succeed. I am the Chief Project Officer at the Invention Corps of UC Berkeley, a high pressure role where I manage industry projects and facilitate client needs. This is challenging in a virtual setting, but I’m always thinking about [ways to bring my team closer](https://medium.com/invention-corps/hi-im-grace-a39d767c5910) and help us be more efficient.

I’ve learned many different ways of solving problems through my various roles: the design-driven approach to parse out user stories, the business approach to identify a market, an engineering approach to break down a problem into solvable components, and a research-driven approach that involves thinking big.
